If you're anything like me - You're a full stack iOS Developer making top notch mobile apps every day. You've got a great experience with either Swift or Objective-C and have gotten quite comfortable with the whole iOS Development ecosystem. You're also know how to code withÂ Java as you've made some Android apps in the past.

You're used to working in two different ecosystems when it comes to creating a cross platform application. You're used to going through the stress of coding the same things twice in two different languages - Java & Swift/Objective-C. You spend hours replicating something that may have taken minutes on another platform. You feel exhausted after your app runs perfectly on iOS but hinders on Android.

You begin to search for a way to end this misery. You take a look at some cross platform solutions. You consider using **[Xamarin](https://xamarin.com). **It seems pretty cool, it has a lot of great reviews and works for a lot of other developers just like you. BUT, then you start considering the amount of time it would take you to learn a completely new programming language talkless of C. So then you begin to reconsider.

You take a look at using PhoneGap but you're looking for a native solution. You don't want to show your users a web view that renders a bunch of HTML.

You're stuck. You can continue the way you are. Spending countless hours of rewriting things in Swift/Obj-C and then in Java. Building the same interface twice while adapting to subtle changes like Material Design.

Or, you could consider using React Native. To put it simply. React-Native is based on ReactJS which is a component based, a javascript web framework.
